# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Goal
### Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Features
- Current date is displayed at top of calendar
- Timeblocks are presented for the correct hours
- Each timeblock is color coded for the day
- Clicking on a save button will save the data to local storage
- Clicking on the trash button will delete the data from local storage
- When you refresh the page the data is still there from local storage

## Roadmap
- Will be continuing to modify the page primarily "cleaning" and "organizing" the app.js to be more readable.

## Project Status
- Status: Busy( Needs to be updated)
